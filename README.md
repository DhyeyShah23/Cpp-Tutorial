# C++ Tutorial Repository

Welcome to my **C++ Tutorial Repository**! This repository serves as a space for me to showcase some of my basic C++ programs while gaining hands-on experience with version control using Git and GitHub.

It can also be a useful resource for beginners looking for program ideas or seeking to build upon my existing work.

## üõ† Setup Instructions
To run the C++ programs on your local machine:
1. Install a C++ compiler (I personally use gcc and clang. You can install them from [Winlibs](https://winlibs.com)).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DhyeyShah23/Cpp-Tutorial.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the folder and compile a program:
   ```sh
   cd Cpp-Tutorial/Basics
   g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello
   ./hello
   ```

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Add your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Added new C++ topic"`).
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
